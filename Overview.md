Overview of all functionalities of the chat plugin

# Introduction #

Here you can find the general information on the chat plugin including screenshots. If you are looking for the install guide you can go to the [install](http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent-chat/wiki/Install) page.


# Details #

## The toolbar button ##

After installation a new button will be added to the ruTorrent toolbar (the one with the blue and green chat clouds):

## The chat window ##

Clicking this button will toggle the chat window, here you can see all the messages and a list of chats (main + all users). If the username in the list has a red color you cannot send a PM to that user because the user has PMs disabled (the user is still shown in the list because he may have sent you a PM before he disabled it and you should be able to read that). If a background is darker grey and the username is blue it means the user has sent you a new PM.

## The chat window without smiley images ##

Depending on your smiley settings in the config file the chat could also be seen without image smileys:

## The chat window with PMs disabled ##

If you have disabled PMs it will not show the available chats window (as you only need the main chat when you don't want to use PMs):

## The smileys ##

If the smileys are enabled the user can click on the smileys link behind the "Add message" text and a new window with the available smileys will pop up.
When you hover over the smiley it tells you the "code" for the smiley or you can simply click the smiley and it will be appended to the message field.
There are currently two types of smileys (although very similar) available and the active type is defined in the config file:

Yes, these smileys are taken from google chat. I'm not that creative myself when it comes to design and these seem to fit in quite good. If you have a suggestion for other icons let me know.


## Clearing the chat ##

If a user has read all the messages (or doesn't want to read them) there is a link to clear the chat located behind the "Messages" text at the top of the chat window. When a user clicks on there a prompt will open with 3 options:

![http://rutorrent-chat.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/clear_prompt.png](http://rutorrent-chat.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/clear_prompt.png)

The options are quite simple: Cancel the operation, clear the chat temporarily so the current chat will be available again after a reload or clear the chat permanent so the chat won't be available anymore even after a page reload.
Note that when you switch between PMs and/or main chat it reload the chat window, so if you clear the chat temporarily it will be available again if you switch to a different chat and back.


## Changing settings ##

Each user can change their chat preferences through the ruTorrent settings menu.
